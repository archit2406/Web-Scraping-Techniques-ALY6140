# Web Scraping Techniques in Python - ALY 6140

## Project Overview
This repository documents the use of Python libraries and frameworks for web scraping, including Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and Scrapy. The project demonstrates the extraction of data from various web sources, showcasing the power of automation and structured data collection in Python.

## Libraries and Tools
- **Beautiful Soup**: Used for parsing HTML and XML documents, making it easier to scrape data from web pages.
- **Selenium**: Automates web browsers, enabling the scraping of dynamic content that Beautiful Soup alone might not access.
- **Scrapy**: An open-source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites in a fast, simple, yet extensible way.

## Applications
- **Billionaire List Extraction**: Using Beautiful Soup to scrape and structure the billionaire list from Wikipedia into a readable format.
- **Amazon Product Scraping**: Employing Selenium to navigate Amazon and extract product details, simulating real-user interactions with the web browser.
- **Large-Scale Web Crawls**: Utilizing Scrapy to perform efficient and large-scale crawls across domains, ideal for projects requiring extensive data extraction.
